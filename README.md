pimaimCageCF has been written primarily by Mathieu Salanne, then rewrote by Maximilien Levesque.

Aim
===

The aim of pimaimCageCF is to compute the so called cage correlation functions from molecular dynamics simulations using the code PIMAIM.

Installation
============

Compilation is very easy using SCONS. It is a better and easier-to-use __make__. You will most certainly find SCONS in the repositories of your Linux distribution. If you use MacOSX, then I have no idea if you'll find it or not. Please let me now.
Once SCONS is installed, just type in your terminal :
``
$ scons
``
